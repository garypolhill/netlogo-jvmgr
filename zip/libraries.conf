    shortDescription: "Various commands for accessing information about the Java Virtual Machine running your NetLogo model"
    longDescription: """The Java Virtual Machine is the 'computer' that runs your NetLogo model, and Java provides various commands to access information about such things as how much of various different kinds of memory you are using, how many threads are running, and how much CPU time your use of NetLogo is taking. The commands in this extension allow you to access this information, which can be helpful, especially in 'headless' mode, in determining whether you need to make adjustments to default settings for the Java Virtual Machines when running the model."""
